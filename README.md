# NFT Projects: MoodNft & BasicNft

This repository contains two Solidity smart contracts that demonstrate basic NFT implementations on Ethereum using the OpenZeppelin library with unit tests and integration tests.

- **MoodNft**: An ERC-721 token that reflects the ownerâ€™s mood. Each minted NFT starts as "Happy" and can have its mood toggled (flipped) between "Happy" and "Sad". The tokenURI dynamically returns metadata based on the current mood, encoded in Base64.
- **BasicNft**: A simple ERC-721 NFT contract that allows minting NFTs with a custom token URI.

## Contracts Overview

### MoodNft
- **Contract Name**: `MoodNft`
- **Key Features**:
  - Mints NFTs that start with a default mood ("Happy").
  - Allows the owner (or approved operator) to flip the NFT's mood between "Happy" and "Sad".
  - Dynamically generates token metadata (including an image URI) using Base64 encoding.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `mintNft()`: Mints a new NFT with an initial mood of "Happy".
  - `flipMood(uint256 tokenId)`: Flips the mood of the specified NFT. Only the owner or approved address can flip the mood.
  - `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the metadata for the NFT based on its current mood.

### BasicNft
- **Contract Name**: `BasicNft`
- **Key Features**:
  - Mints NFTs with a user-defined token URI.
  - Maintains a mapping from token IDs to their corresponding URIs.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `mintNft(string memory tokenUri)`: Mints a new NFT with the provided token URI.
  - `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Returns the stored token URI for the NFT.
